# UX Artefacts - Motion Guidelines

## Motion Principles

- Slow, breathing-like loops in illustration layers
- Single focus animation on selection (scale + glow)
- Never shake or flash

## Timing

- Enter: 500-700ms
- Hover/press: 120-180ms
- Idle float loop: 6-10s

## Step Transitions

- Crossfade between steps
- Progress dots slide to next state

## Story Experience

- Parallax drift at 10-15px
- Gentle floating elements with staggered delays
